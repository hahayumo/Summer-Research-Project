# Using AutoML to Evaluate Financial Time Series Models
Financial time series generating models are commonly introduced and compared by how well the simulations match the so-called stylised facts. In this project, we propose a new metric: the difficulty of distinguishing simulated data from real-market data, to evaluate the quality of a model. We assess the difficulty by the out-of-sample error rate of binary classification, which is performed by utilising an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) package. The feasibility of this approach was investigated by comparing three classic bivariate continuous-time stochastic process models. We found that simpler diffusion models such as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, underperforming more realistic models, like jump-diffusion or stochastic volatility model, by showing a lower error rate.
